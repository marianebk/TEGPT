# Pixel location fudge

Assignee: Mike Yoffa
Created by: Mike Schiraldi
Description: Add a line to a TBD file that fudges all pixels in a panel by a specified x, y, and z. Even better, have some way to adjust this fudge in the LX UI so you donâ€™t have to restart the whole system just to try a new fudge value.
