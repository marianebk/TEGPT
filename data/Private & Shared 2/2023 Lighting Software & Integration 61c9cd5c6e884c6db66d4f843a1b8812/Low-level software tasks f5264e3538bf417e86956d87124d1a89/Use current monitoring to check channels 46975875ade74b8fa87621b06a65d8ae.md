# Use current monitoring to check channels

Assignee: Mike Schiraldi
Created by: Mike Schiraldi
Description: • Give the validator and/or pinger a command-line option to print channels that are drawing near-zero current. That way, we can tell the car to light up, and any channel that’s supposed to be doing something but isn’t drawing any real current is probably not hooked up right.
