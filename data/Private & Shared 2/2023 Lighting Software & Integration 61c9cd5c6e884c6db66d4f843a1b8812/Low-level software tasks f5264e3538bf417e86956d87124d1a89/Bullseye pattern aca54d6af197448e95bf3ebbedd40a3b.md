# Bullseye pattern

Assignee: Mike Yoffa
Created by: Mike Schiraldi
Description: Create an LX pattern where a person at FoH can quickly select a weird-looking pixel and have the car draw a bullseye circle around it, using its good neighbors, and have the bad pixel blink through a cycle of R, G, B, W so that we can tell whether it’s a defective channel or just a loose pixel that’s too far from the diffuser. It should be quick and easy to zero in on these pixels, and you should be able to mark many at once.
