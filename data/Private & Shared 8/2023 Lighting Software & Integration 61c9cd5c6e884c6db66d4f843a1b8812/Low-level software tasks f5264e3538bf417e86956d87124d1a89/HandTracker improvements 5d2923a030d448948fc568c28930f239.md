# HandTracker improvements

Assignee: Mike Yoffa

Description: Currently this pattern only paints the show side of the car. Enhance it to cover all four sides, either as four rectangles or a cylinder. (Dealerâ€™s choice.) Also nice would be the ability to have many lines sweeping at once and to have them auto-sweep. And hey, for the sake of cool patterns, allow arbitrary diagonals too. Maybe fork the pattern into separate test and eye-candy versions.
Priority: P0
