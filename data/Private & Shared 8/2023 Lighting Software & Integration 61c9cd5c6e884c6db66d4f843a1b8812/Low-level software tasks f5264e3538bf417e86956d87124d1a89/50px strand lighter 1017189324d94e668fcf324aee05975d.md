# 50px strand lighter

Assignee: Mike Schiraldi

Description: • Write a script that takes an IP+channel, or a fixture ID, plus an offset into that fixture, and lights up the 50-pixel strand containing that pixel so someone on the car can see if there’s a problem affecting that entire strand, and if so, they’ll know exactly which pixels have to be ripped out so the strand can be replaced. It should also have the ability to light up the first n pixels within a channel in one color and the rest in another color, which would be useful in situations like where only part of an edge is lighting up and we want to confirm that its configured length matches reality.
