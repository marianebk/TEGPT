## Overview
Purpose

Our networks are used for:

1. **LED control**. Over 110 LED controllers controlling >85,000 LEDs receiving pixel information from a Mac Studio running the Chromatik pattern engine.
2. **Laser control**. 12 projectors controlled by Pangolin Beyond running on an Intel NUC.
3. **~~Projection mapping**. A Mac Studio, sometimes ingesting live webcam data, driving 4 short throw projectors in the Ice Lounge.~~
4. **Audio control**. Remote management of Allen & Heath headless digital rack mixer and Dante data for several X8 amps.
5. **Pioneer DJ Link**. Up to 5 CDJ-3000s and a V10 mixer, connected to each other as well as ShowKontrol to feed tempo, beat, phrase, and track waveform preview data to other systems.
6. **Front-Of-House**. A dedicated high speed point-to-point disk link that extends the on-car LAN to the control booth where the LED VJ, Laser operator, and Sound Engineer all control their systems over remote desktop connections.
7. **Crew WiFi**. Ubiquity APs around the car for crew laptops to access the systems above flexibly around the car, and to share our upstream internet (Starlink) in remote locations.

### Physical Layout

The majority of the network concerns are coexisting on one LAN, with the following exceptions:

1. DJ Link devices live on an isolated [VLAN](Networking%20and%20Front%20of%20House%20Setup%20fe5360a00b594955b735e02115548ff4.md). The ShowKontrol computer has two NICs, one on the LAN and one on the DJ Link VLAN.
2. Audio Control is on a separate network due to that vendor‚Äôs adorable habits, timelines, and peculiarities. He uses it some years. 
3. Upstream internet (venue WiFi, Starlink, Personal HotSpot or wired upstream) is considered WAN.

There are [45 wired ports distributed in 5 weatherproof patch panels](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Lj-hovCMH-IyVQV6PKU_ADQEh9bYlXcRrHoYI6OkcE/edit?gid=1391190856#gid=1391190856) located around the car‚Äôs perimeter. These are used for connecting to LED controllers, lasers, WiFi APs, the P2P wireless FoH link, and DJ equipment (‚ùómust be only plugged in to a DJ VLAN port).

The ports around the car are connected to a 48-port enterprise switch mounted vertically against a wall in the server closet. The server closet is adjacent to the ‚Äúk-hole‚Äù elevated crawlspace and has filtered air conditioning. 

Most of our valuable network equipment sits in one removable rack. The rack is removable for convenient R&D/maintenance as well as for avoiding theft, vibration in transit, and extreme weather. For shows, the network rack is placed in the server closet. The enterprise network switch on the server closet wall is then bridged to the identical switch in the removable rack by connecting the four rightmost SFP ports together. This is called a link aggregation group; using multiple ethernet cables provides redundancy and increases bandwidth. This LAG configuration also is configured to preserve VLAN tagging across the two devices. 

### Remote Access

All computers have TailScale VPN installed for [remote desktop access](https://www.notion.so/2023-Lighting-Software-Integration-61c9cd5c6e884c6db66d4f843a1b8812?pvs=21). This is primarily to be used between shows when the rack is removed from the car but powered. In an emergency, it could theoretically be used for remote troubleshooting during a performance if the car has internet access.

During a show, the main computers (lighting-1, showkontrol-3, laser-4) are meant to be controlled from the Front of House via OSX Screen Sharing (or Microsoft Remote Desktop). 

### Product Documentation and Firmware

All manuals and firmware are kept on [a Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1z8Ywqvw5b2SNnMwsjORi_HgAesaxSp2K) which is local-access (mirrored) to all of the computers.
 

### Redundancy

| Computer and software | Backup system |
| --- | --- |
| `lighting-1` [Chromatik](https://chromatik.co/) | `lighting-2` Chromatik
`lighting-10-FOH`- FOH Chromatik
`mship-led` - Mothership Chromatik - in an emergency, should be plugged into TE LAN and render pixels over the 150‚Äô Cat6 snake |
| `laser-4` Pangolin Beyond | `lighting-2` Parallels (license must be transferred or cached offline before the show) |
| `showkontrol-3` ShowKontrol or BTL | `lighting-2` ShowKontrol or BLT |
| UDM Pro as router and [DHCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol) server | None - reconfigure network to use MotherShip‚Äôs UDM Pro and pray.  |
| UDM Pro‚Äôs role as the UniFi controller (AP Config, switch adoption) | UniFi mobile app on our phones, or the UniFi App on Lighting-2 |
| 48-port enterprise network Switch | Other network switch running in a collapsed/flatter LAN. Pioneer DJ LINK VLAN may need physical isolation - reconnect DJ LINK LAN with a separate 8-port switch direct to showkontrol-3‚Äôs secondary NIC |
| WAN Wifi Client | A spare OpenWRT or DD-WRT device (blue LinkSys) can be swapped in. Unlikely to be critical at BM with our current Starlink-as-primary WAN config. |
| FoH P2P Link | Spare NanoBeam / PowerBeam
White 150‚Äô 4 x Cat6 Snake  |
| [BomeBox](https://www.bome.com/products/bomebox) | Spare BomeBox in bins, also Bome Network can be the USB device hub |

### Startup Automation

- All computers are set up to boot following loss of power, and auto-login to the primary user
- `lighting-1` Starts Chromatik automatically
- `showcontrol-3` has startup scripts to launch ShowKontrol and our Max OSC router
- Lasers never start automatically as a safety measure

## Network Device List and Functional Descriptions

The definitive record of **IP address allocation** is kept in the Networking Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Lj-hovCMH-IyVQV6PKU_ADQEh9bYlXcRrHoYI6OkcE/edit?gid=1303362726#gid=1303362726 (because it supports a more robust offline mode than Notion). IP Addresses are assigned by the DHCP Service of the UDM Pro routers (this can assign reserved IPs outside the main DHCP dynamic pool range), or done via manual IP setup for critical devices such as `lighting-1`

### Show Coordination

A key tenant of our system is that we cannot guarantee a trained VJ is present at all times that DJs are performing. To support this, we have systems to vary the visual show like a more-intelligent screensaver.

The LEDs use a custom developed module for Chromatik we call Auto-VJ. The lasers can use ‚ÄúVirtual LJ‚Äù, which is a dumb playlist that advances the pattern every X beats on the current page of cues. Both of these rely on knowing the current tempo (BPM) so they can roughly change things to the music.

Phrases are the sections of a song that do not have major thematic changes within them. In EDM, they‚Äôre almost always 32 beats long, and occasionally 16. If a DJ uses Pioneer Rekordbox‚Äôs ‚ÄúPhrase Analysis‚Äù feature, our show can be much more intelligent since it knowns when to change the lighting to match key moments and the current mood. The common phrase types is can differentiate are UP (buildups, verses), DOWN (breakdowns, bridges), and CHORUS (peak moments). Many times our DJs do not perform phrase analysis, so the key role of a trained VJ is to make major changes happen on phrase changes, especially ‚Äúthe drops‚Äù. Showkontrol and Beat Link Trigger are the two options we choose between for each show. They are displayed on the middle monitor, in front of our Lighting Director role (if we are staffing one), directly between the LED Operator and Laser Operator.

The ‚Äúmiddlewares‚Äù called ShowKontrol and Beat Link Trigger allow us to:

1. See the music waveform previews that are shown to the DJs on the CDJ decks. 
2. Receive BPM changes, beat markers, downbeat (beat 1 of 4) events, and phrase changes from the DJ decks and convert them to OSC messages that can be sent over the network.

OSC messages from Showkontrol or Beat Link Trigger are first routed to [a Max/MSP script](https://github.com/titanicsend/LXStudio-TE/blob/main/te-app/resources/scripts/TE_OSC_Dispatcher.maxpat) running on the same computer,  `showkontrol-3`. This serves as an OSC router and can filter messages before sending them on to Chromatik (LEDs) or Pangolin Beyond (Lasers).

### VLANs

### Understanding VLANs

- A VLAN is a set of ports that can all talk to each other in isolation from the other ports on the switch. You can route traffic between VLANs using a router or VLAN config. Technically a VLAN is a broadcast domain, so something like a DHCP server, which responds to broadcast packets requesting an IP address, can only field requests that exist within it‚Äôs VLAN.
- A Link Aggregation Group (LAG) is a set of ports that act as a single cable. We LAG the 4 highest numbered ports between our two enterprise 48-port switches.
- VLAN member ports are either tagged or untagged. A configured VLAN can still isolate traffic even if it doesn‚Äôt add tags, just by designating only certain physical ports as untagged members or non-members.
    - A VLAN tag is a number (like ‚Äú200‚Äù) that is added to an ethernet frame.
    - Tagging is used to combine many VLANs‚Äô traffic over a single cable (or the LAG), then split it back out to separate VLANs on the other side of that link.
- An untagged port means that traffic that exits that port will have its VLAN tag ripped off
- A tagged port will add the VLAN number to all ethernet frames that leave that port
- A computer‚Äôs network interface can be configured in Windows/OSX to add a VLAN tag, but this is uncommon and we don‚Äôt use it this way.
- To add a VLAN tag at switch port ingress, you must both:
    1. Define the port to be a member of that VLAN on the switch‚Äôs VLAN config admin page,
    2. Set up the Port VLAN ID (PVID) to add the tag
- We do PVIDs and untagged membership, then define the LAG as a trunk that tags traffic between the switches. Non-VLAN traffic is essentially ‚ÄúVLAN 1‚Äù and is always untagged. It flows untagged through the LAG alongside tagged VLAN frames.

### Current VLANs

| Tag | Meaning |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The Default VLAN, as if you didn‚Äôt define any. ‚ÄúTE LAN‚Äù usually refers to this, and is 10.0.0.0/9 (10.0.0.1 - 10.127.255.255, the latter of which is the broadcast IP address).

Most traffic uses this by default, notably:
1. Communication between TE rack computers / Mothership computers, such as remote desktop, OSC, SSH, etc.
2. Computers reaching the internet via Starlink or the rack‚Äôs WiFi Client
3. [Chroma.tech](http://Chroma.tech) controller pixel data - our highest bandwidth and traffic backlog risk point |  |
| 2 | **TE Crew**. Configure this only if TE camp member devices may be interfering with our TE LAN show. Assign APs to this VLAN and get them the fuck off and TE LAN stuff (perhaps by changing the WiFi password for SSID ‚ÄúTE LAN‚Äù) |  |
| 3 | **Audio**. Configure only if Pascal needs this, to isolate management traffic to the main D-Live audio mixer, Powersoft amp‚Äôs Armonia app, or DANTE or AES67 digital audio streams.  |  |
| 5 | **Lasers**. Configure this if the lasers seem to have network issues (Purple status bars at the bottom of Pangolin - see below*). You‚Äôll need to use a second USB Ethernet interface on the laser computer - continue to use the main ethernet port for VLAN 1. |  |
| 200 | **Pioneer DJ-LINK**, in auto-IP (AKA [APIPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-local_address)) mode (the default way we use them). This is the most critical VLAN to keep isolated; if Pioneer equipment is plugged into a normal VLAN 1 port, this **will** fuck the LEDs. **Always used.** Connect only to a secondary ethernet interface on the Showkontrol / Beat Link Trigger computer and the DJ gear. Clearly label any ethernet cables and ports out on the car used for the VLAN. |  |
| 400 | **Pioneer DJ-LINK**, in DHCP mode (rarely needed). There may be a need to know an exact IP address for each player, done via a DHCP IP reservation to each player‚Äôs MAC address. You‚Äôll need to switch the connected ports from VLAN 200 to 400. Also see VLAN 200‚Äôs warnings above.  |  |

* Note that red or yellow backgrounds are laser-content related delays, not networking issues. Purple text means a network reliability problem:

### Step-by-Step

1. Access either switch‚Äôs admin interface. Logged in to Chrome as titanicsend@gmail.com, find it easily here: Or, to access directly by IP address, always remember [every IP is here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Lj-hovCMH-IyVQV6PKU_ADQEh9bYlXcRrHoYI6OkcE/edit?gid=1303362726#gid=1303362726) and [every password is here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JMT-oSenwYVS_fpXtLfjlVQqChUMWMs7pdlXXzdgqD4/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

2. Review the existing VLAN IDs
    
    ![Monosnap lighting-2 2024-08-06 12-40-26.png](Networking%20and%20Front%20of%20House%20Setup%20fe5360a00b594955b735e02115548ff4/Monosnap_lighting-2_2024-08-06_12-40-26.png)
    
3. Assign physical ports to particular VLANs as either untagged members (U) or not members. For example, here is the membership for the default network, VLAN 1. Compare it to the membership for the isolated Pioneer DJ-LINK, VLAN 200.
    
    ![Monosnap lighting-2 2024-08-06 12-43-48.png](Networking%20and%20Front%20of%20House%20Setup%20fe5360a00b594955b735e02115548ff4/Monosnap_lighting-2_2024-08-06_12-43-48.png)
    
    ![Monosnap lighting-2 2024-08-06 12-47-06.png](Networking%20and%20Front%20of%20House%20Setup%20fe5360a00b594955b735e02115548ff4/Monosnap_lighting-2_2024-08-06_12-47-06.png)
    
4. If a VLAN needs a DHCP server, make sure it‚Äôs able to reach the UDM Pro (main router in the TE rack). This means there‚Äôs an assigned untagged member port connected to it, and the VLAN ID of the ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù is assigned in the Ubiquity Network app on the router as well.
    
    ![Monosnap lighting-2 2024-08-06 15-19-12.png](Networking%20and%20Front%20of%20House%20Setup%20fe5360a00b594955b735e02115548ff4/Monosnap_lighting-2_2024-08-06_15-19-12.png)
    

## Front of House (FoH)

The Front of House is a booth or table where the LED VJ, Laser VJ, and sound engineer can remotely control the show from a position embedded in the rear of the audience. On many shows this will be from our second art car, Mothership. Other times we‚Äôll be given a desk (like at Coachella or Framework) and we have a traditional touring-rated lighting desk for that. We sometimes invite audience participation from FoH with MIDI controllers.

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Common gotcha: **Train people that the normal state for all computers is WiFi-off, ethernet cable connected.** Someone see‚Äôs a WiFi interface turned off (on iPads, laptops, or anything else at FoH) and decides to turn them on, perhaps even correctly joining WiFi ‚ÄúTE LAN‚Äù. If the wired ethernet interface on the same machine is also connected, some of our configurations will cause very bad loopbacks spamming the network. We‚Äôve considered disabling the WiFi interfaces on FoH devices, but this makes it very difficult to perform emergency walk-around maintenance in other situations.

</aside>

### There are two modes for connecting FoH ‚Üî Car (only use one at a time!)

1. **Ethernet cable mode (e.g.: EDC, playa backup)**
    1. The Car‚Äôs LAN (any non-VLAN port of the large 48-port switches) is directly connected to the smaller FoH switch via a very long ethernet cable, AKA a snake. 
2. **PTP WiFi bridge mode (e.g.: Burning Man)**
    - We use Ubiquiti AirMAX dishes, one on each side. (one on the car, and one at front of house)
        1. The car has a NanoBeam 5AC (30 deg antenna) mounted high - this is in ‚ÄúAP Mode‚Äù, but it is not a router.
        2. The FoH booth uses either the larger PowerBeam 5AC dish (10 deg antenna), or our spare 30 deg NanoBeam (such as on Mothership). It is NOT in AP mode. It‚Äôs wired connection is connected to the FoH network switch. 
    - **Additional information to understand and configure this link**
        - The antennae powered by the white PoE injectors that go between the antenna and its wired network.
        - As a bridge, these have no router. They do not perform [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) - think of them as a direct replacement for a long ethernet cable, but they happen to have IP addresses and some configuration on each end. They still have a SSID (‚ÄùTE FoH‚Äù) and password for encrypting the link‚Äôs traffic, set on the AP side (the car‚Äôs dish).
        - Their Point-2-Point wireless link uses the 5 GHz band but is not WiFi-compatible (it‚Äôs a proprietary AirMAX RF modulation). With line-of-site, the link is capable of a symmetric 450 Mbps.
        - These also have a separate, normal WiFi radio reserved for management/admin. These radios are only active and making a visible network within the first 10 minutes from the dish being powered up. The SSID‚Äôs can be found as ‚ÄúPBE-XXX-XXetc‚Äù for the PowerBeam, and ‚ÄúNBE-XX-XXetc‚Äù for the NanoBeams. Connect to one from a phone running the UISP app to configure that device. The username is ‚Äòubnt‚Äô and passwords are in [the password sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JMT-oSenwYVS_fpXtLfjlVQqChUMWMs7pdlXXzdgqD4/edit?gid=0#gid=0).
        - These devices are not part of Ubiquity‚Äôs UniFi consumer line. They‚Äôre part of the UISP line. To configure them, download the UISP app. Alternately, they can be managed by the cloud-based UISP service.
        - The channel width is set on the AP side of the link (the car‚Äôs dish). Generally we‚Äôve found 40MHz channel width to be best ‚Äî if you‚Äôre on a bad width you‚Äôll see the frequency change frequently in the UISP app connected to the P2P client (the FoH side of the link). Try different channels and widths with the UISP mobile app managing the AP side to see what gets you the best capacity. This is easiest with two phones, one connected to the management interface of each dish.

## Show Setup Procedures

### Build / Setup

- [ ]  *Please edit and correct this list AS YOU GO, AS LONG AS YOU READ IT TO THE END FIRST*
- [ ]  **SEE ALSO** TE BM 2023 Software Runbook / Troubleshooting
    
    [TE BM 2023 Runbook / Troubleshooting](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1to4eDjwxo6PlV5Hcj9IzWTWRQrwOwAkF-6hyYwhbESs/edit#slide=id.g23c0395a3d7_0_16)
    

### **At Titanics End - Car**

- [ ]  **Install Network rack in the car‚Äôs server closet** - Important: check with Build Manager about the order of installation vs Audio Racks to prevent heavy rework
- [ ]  **Connect main network rack to side rack**. Connect 4 ethernet cords between the rightmost (gold) SFP ethernet ports on the Rack‚Äôs 48 port switch and the 48 port switch mounted in the closet‚Äôs outer wall.  Of the three, we sometimes use one via an optical cable. The show is still fully good to go if any 2 of these are working.
- [ ]  **Power the AC unit** and ensure it‚Äôs exhaust is correctly routed
- [ ]  **Power both the car-mounted ethernet switch and the rack in the server closet.** The generator powers the outlets in the back of the closet, or a Power Lead may have powered the car via shore power while building or at camp. If this isn‚Äôt ready but you‚Äôre ready to boot and test things, run your own extension cord to any source. You should see lights on ports for both of the network racks. This will also power any PoE devices distributed around the car‚Äôs 5 ethernet junction boxes.
- [ ]  **Connect the DJ booth to the network.** Inside the network closet, in the back, you‚Äôll see a white Ethernet cord called ‚ÄúDj Booth‚Äù written on tape on that coord. Ensure it‚Äôs plugged into the SIDE network switch (on the right as you look into the closet and turn your head right) using one of the bottom 4 ports - these are VLAN‚Äôed to the Pioneer DJ network.
- [ ]  **Chain Laser ethernet.** When lasers are mounted, chain their Ethernet. For EDC, we successfully ran chains of 3 (left), 6 (above DJ), 3 (right). It‚Äôs most convenient to also do safety keys, TRUE1 power chains, and eStops (chained DMX 3-pin or XLR) at this time.
    - [ ]  Confirm whether you are using a separate Laser VLAN - if so, check that the ports the lasers connect to are designated as untagged members (see VLAN section above)
    - [ ]  Route eStop (XLR) cables from various chains to the central eStop splitter which is likely to be installed in the server rack.
- [ ]  When an audio team member (Jordan / Kian / Liam / Brendan / Aakash / Pascal) can help, connect 2x XLR line-outs from the rack mixer in the closet to the USB audio interface in the network rack.
- [ ]  Connect any sound output from computers used for timed shows (such as Mothership‚Äôs bootup sequence) to the D-LIVE Mixer‚Äôs line-in
- [ ]  Mount and connect at least two UniFi WiFi APs around the car, near the ethernet port boxes (most shows: front of the car). You‚Äôll find the APs in the little white drawstring you found the SFP/LAG link ethernet cables in above.
- [ ]  Mount and plug in ethernet for the TE‚Äôs P2P dish - we typically mount this disk to a speaker bracket arm‚Äôs round tube (suggest routing Ethernet cable to a rear network junction box).
- [ ]  Mount Starlink up high on TE (beefy zip ties to frame). Connect StarLink‚Äôs ethernet adapter cord to port 9 (WAN icon) on the main enterprise router (UniFi Dream Machine Pro, top of rack).

### **At Front of House (Mothership, or other FoH desk)**

- [ ]  Setup the FoH network
    - [ ]  Connect the following to the TE LAN network switch:
        - [ ]  FoH dish using PoE adaptor to the TE LAN switch. Use the official Ubiquity PoE injectors for these antennas - they CANNOT be powered via typical PoE.
            - [ ]  Or, a designated cable (labeled A, B, C, or D) from the Cat6 tactical white snake
            - [ ]  Or, and I‚Äôm sorry you seem to be so fucked, one of the spare 180‚Äô Cat5 cables
        - [ ]  `lighting-10-FOH`
        - [ ]  iPad dongles‚Äô wired ethernet
            - [ ]  Connect USB-C power to the iPad dongles.  The power supply to each iPad must be ‚â• 40 watts because the dongle uses 20W itself. This is more than a stock iPad power supply.
        - [ ]  Bome Box ethernet. It doesn‚Äôt matter which BomeBox ethernet port you choose.
            - [ ]  Connect the powered USB hub to the Bome box
                - [ ]  Connect all midi devices we want to send to LX to the USB hub (x2 MF Twisters, APC40, APC Mini, and for some shows the MF64)
                - [ ]  Connect the powered USB hub to AC power
            - [ ]  If PoE is not possible, power the Bome Box off the microUSB port (can be a spare from it‚Äôs own powered USB hub):

        - [ ]  MSHIP LAN‚Äôs UDM Pro router - WAN port (globe icon)
    - [ ]  Connect the following to the MSHIP LAN network switch:
        - [ ]  MSHIP LAN‚Äôs UDM Pro router - Any LAN port
        - [ ]  `mship-led`
        - [ ]  `mship-laser`
            - [ ]  Connect MIDI devices over USB to the laser computer (Traktor F1, APC Mini, and for some shows and APC40 or MF64, etc)
            - [ ]  Wire Mothership‚Äôs laser eStops (DMX) in a chain to an easily accessible eStop on the laser desk
        - [ ]  Mothership [Chroma.tech](http://Chroma.tech) LED controllers
        - [ ]  Mothership lasers‚Äô ethernet **input** side of laser data ports (important for BM‚Äô24): 2 of TE4, TE6, or TE8
        - [ ]  Beacon ArtNet ethernet cables
    - [ ]  Connect all power cables and screens.

### **LED and Laser Integration testing**

- [ ]  Power Mothership - all computers should auto-boot
- [ ]  Power the rack in the car and wait 2 minutes
- [ ]  Confirm all devices have their WiFi OFF (Laptops, iPads). This can cause network disruption.
- [ ]  Confirm iPads and any FoH laptops are charging to avoid surprises later.
- [ ]  Verify remote desktop from FoH to all TE Rack computers: lighting-1, lighting-2, showkontrol-3, lasers-4, GPU laptop
- [ ]  Verify auto-startup scripts started the correct build of Chromatik in auto-DJ mode on `lighting-1`, ShowKontrol and MaxMSP on `showkontrol-3`
- [ ]  Verify internet connectivity via Starlink or WiFi client.
    - [ ]  If bandwidth is a potential issue, consider doing the following after changing the StarLink WiFi password so general camp members aren‚Äôt streaming or competing for bandwidth.
    - [ ]  If Starlink‚Äôs wired Ethernet connection isn‚Äôt working, you can configure the GL iNet client mode router to connect to the Starlink as a wireless client and bridge internet to the car‚Äôs UDM router‚Äôs port 8 (WAN2). Connecting to an existing WiFi network via this WAN2 client mode router is the default setup we use in the Santa Rosa Studio.
- [ ]  The lighting lead should have had a team already connect the various structural modules‚Äôs 16 and 5 port switches to power (16-port), PoE port (5-ports), and connect ethernet to all power/controller backpacks
- [ ]  Verify MIDI controllers have connected to the BomeBox Network apps
    
    ### MIDI Controller setup
    
    The LED and Laser computers for each car receive color coordination MIDI and brightness fader data from the Lighting Director‚Äôs APC Mini; The LED and laser computers on TE also connect to the remote MIDI controllers located on MOTHERSHIP.
    
    ![MIDI Network.png](Networking%20and%20Front%20of%20House%20Setup%20fe5360a00b594955b735e02115548ff4/MIDI_Network.png)
    
     
    
    ## Bome and MIDI Setup steps
    
    - [ ]  Confirm Power light is lit on the BomeBox.  Confirm midi surfaces have some lit LEDs.
    
    ### The Director‚Äôs APC Mini - Color and Brightness faders
    
    To split the Director‚Äôs color messages out to all four computers requires that we create a Virtual Port on the BomeBox for each consumer, and split the Director‚Äôs APC Mini outgoing MIDI to all computers.
    
    1. TE‚Äôs LED computer, `lighting-1`, sends bidirectionally; it is ‚Äúconfigured‚Äù (button colors set) by `lighting-1`. It must have bidirectional routes added on the BomeBox (named ‚ÄúFoH‚Äù) to and from a virtual port named ‚Äú**Director**‚Äù. Chromatik setup code depends on this name.
    2. TE‚Äôs Laser computer, `laser-4`, receives Director MIDI via the virtual MIDI port named **Director-to-laser-4**
    3. Mothership‚Äôs LED computer, `mship-led`, receives Director MIDI via the virtual MIDI port named **Director-to-mship-led**
    4. Mothership‚Äôs laser computer, `mship-laser`, receives Director MIDI via the virtual MIDI port named **Director-to-mship-laser**
    
    ### Setup Steps
    
    1. On the BomeBox, create these four virtual MIDI ports:
        
        ![Monosnap Bome Network 2024-08-14 22-56-23.png](Networking%20and%20Front%20of%20House%20Setup%20fe5360a00b594955b735e02115548ff4/Monosnap_Bome_Network_2024-08-14_22-56-23.png)
        
    2. Again on the FoH BomeBox, add bidirectional routes for **Director**, and Controller-to-Virtual Port routes for the others. Here is the subset of routes you will need to create - you‚Äôll likely see other routes automatically in this list.
        
        <aside>
        ‚ùó Each APC Mini mkii will appear as two devices. Always select and map the one that appears as either ‚Äú**APC mini mk2 [1]**‚Äù or ‚Äú**APC mini mk2 Control**‚Äù
        
        </aside>
        
        ![Monosnap Bome Network 2024-08-14 23-02-53.png](Networking%20and%20Front%20of%20House%20Setup%20fe5360a00b594955b735e02115548ff4/Monosnap_Bome_Network_2024-08-14_23-02-53.png)
        
    3. Now, switching to each of the computers that need to receive these colors, use the Bome Network app to connect to the ‚ÄúFoH‚Äù BomeBox, and enable (connect to) the matching virtual port. Using the network diagram above, make sure each Bome Network app is connected to the particular MIDI controllers it needs.
        
        ![Monosnap Laser-4-3 via client router on V 2024-08-14 15-35-15.png](Networking%20and%20Front%20of%20House%20Setup%20fe5360a00b594955b735e02115548ff4/Monosnap_Laser-4-3_via_client_router_on_V_2024-08-14_15-35-15.png)
        
    
    After the Director‚Äôs Virtual routes are created, connect each computer to the MIDI controllers it needs.

        - [ ]  If the TouchOSC diplays are not responding when parameters are changed, verify that their IP addresses match what is configured in the MaxMSP patch. Currently they are 10.100.0.201 and 10.100.0.202. If connected via the wired ethernet dongles, they will get these IP addresses from the main car‚Äôs router. If connected via WiFi (not recommended), you will need to manually assign these IPs with subnet mast 255.128.0.0 and router 10.0.0.1.

### Pioneer DJ Link / ShowKontrol / Beat Link Trigger

- [ ]  Verify the Pioneer DJ Link network is communicating with our ShowKontrol
    - [ ]  Verify ShowKontrol or BLT running on `showkontrol-3` can see the Pioneer equipment on auto-assigned IP addresses on VLAN 200
    - [ ]  Verify all decks are communicating via DJ Link. Verify all decks can access a library of music plugged into one deck‚Äôs USB. Load a track in each deck and verify that maximizing the fader assigned to each deck will change that deck to display ‚ÄúMaster‚Äù.
    - [ ]  Verify all decks are running the latest firmware.
        
        [CDJ-3000 Firmware Update Guide](https://support.pioneerdj.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413929605529-CDJ-3000-Firmware-Update-Guide-)
        
    - [ ]  Verify each deck has a manually-assigned player number that matches the channel it is plugged into on the mixer.  Verify there are no player number conflicts.
    - [ ]  Verify ethernet connection to each CDJ and the mixer.
    - [ ]  In each CDJ/Mixer menu, confirm IP address is as expected
- [ ]  Verify ShowKontrol is sending tempo and OSC messages to LEDs and Lasers
    - [ ]  Play a track on the CDJs and verify the tempo is updated in Chromatik and Beyond
    - [ ]  TBD: Get tempo into Pangolin QuickShow on `mship-laser` via Midi Timecode
    - [ ]  TBD: Instead distribute tempo and beat to Pangolin Beyond on `laser-4` via Ableton Link
        - [ ]  JKB Note: BeatLinkTrigger has Ableton LInk and we could configure it to share for Pangolin

### DJ Lights (set up and control)

The DJ lights are two moving head wash lights controlled over Artnet using DMX Wifi Dongles (Stealth Wash Zoom - Eliminator)

- These lights are used to light up the DJ deck and area. Expand these headings for pictures.

## Set up

- Make sure the moving head lights are installed physically on the bridge beam at the same time as the lasers. Otherwise installation becomes very difficult and requires heavy machinery.
- Moving head lights require one global truss C clamp each. Ensure that you secure the metal safety harness around the beam as a backup in case the C clamp fails. (See below)

- Space out the lights on the beam to make sure you can make an X pattern down to the DJ decks so that the DJ isn't blinded by the lights. See photo below for configuration

- DJ Light House **Left should be on DMX address 101 and the Right should be on 121**
    - This can be checked on the DJ lights‚Äô screen on the device itself by pressing the menu button (see below)
        
        ![1000029009.jpg](Networking%20and%20Front%20of%20House%20Setup%20fe5360a00b594955b735e02115548ff4/1000029009.jpg)
        
- The **VJ iPad 2** is the main control surface for the lights
    - The Illuminator app on the iPad will is needed to control the lights
- Open the Illuminator app and make sure the Artnet interface is enabled
    - Go to connections ‚Üí Artnet should ‚Äúon‚Äù and inside the artnet menu the Universe 1 should be ‚Äúon‚Äù too
- The lights should be connected to the app and controllable by the app
- Keep in mind that the lights are grouped under the  ‚ÄúDJ Washes‚Äù group (see below)
- The recommended setting is WHITE/AMBER, indicated below in the yellow button called ‚ÄúDefault settings‚Äù. Generally any other color wasn't bright enough to fully illuminate the DJ. It is recommended to set the lights to the default setting at the beginning of the the show and leave it for the rest of the night

## Troubleshooting

1. If you are not sure what are the IPs of the device, you can find them on the Ubiquity interface
    1. as of now, they should be Right (10.6.2.102) and Left (10.6.2.101)
2. The lights should be flashing slowly and the colors on both dongle should match (as of now Red)
3. The Eliminator stealth wash zoom lights are technically INDOOR rated. In the case they stop working, you can setup nanlites behind the DJ decks with the tripod stands included in the nanlites bag. Make sure to adjust the lights downwards not to blind the DJs!

### Troubleshooting Checklist: Loss of FoH ‚Üî Car Connectivity

- [ ]  Check link lights on FoH switches
- [ ]  Check LED indicator for link strength on the P2P link‚Äôs antenna dish
- [ ]  Using a mobile phone, connect to P2P Dish‚Äôs management WiFi radio (NME-XX-XXXX or PBE-XX-XXXX)
    - [ ]  If you can‚Äôt see this open network, it‚Äôs been more than 10 minutes since that side of the link was powered on. Power cycle the NanoBeam or PowerBeam.
    - [ ]  Use the UISP iPhone App. Credentials are in [the sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JMT-oSenwYVS_fpXtLfjlVQqChUMWMs7pdlXXzdgqD4/edit?gid=0#gid=0); username ubnt and typical ‚ÄúNetwork layer‚Äù password
    - [ ]  Verify the SSID, WiFi link password, and link‚Äôs strength
    - [ ]  Use site survey to look for RF interference and test antenna orientation
    - [ ]  If possible, perform the same for the NanoBeam on the car.
- [ ]  MIDI troubleshooting
    - [ ]  Remote into `lighting-1` and verify the Bome Network Tool is running
