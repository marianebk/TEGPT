# Create foreign NDI (tie up) VLAN for lighting-1 for Long Feng / Gallery tie ups.

Done: Done
Assigned To: Justin, Sina Solaimanpour
By Date: August 23, 2024
Notes: A new VLAN to the left of the laser VLAN - two vertical ports. Good practice. Coordinate with @Sina Solaimanpour - who may as well use one of these for our GPU NDI feed as well.
