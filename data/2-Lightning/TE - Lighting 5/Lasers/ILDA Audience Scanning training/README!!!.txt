DO NOT REDISTRIBUTE!

The recording was provided courtesy of ILDA to me (Jeff). I had a client pay for this course to get audience scanning added to our Big Arts FDA laser variance. This audience scanning course is normally not allowed to be delivered remotely / async due to the complex nature and safety implications. My relationship with the president of ILDA is on the line here.

Thank you,

- Jeff
